# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease using patient health indicators.

## Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP Neural Network)

## Technologies
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Visualization of health features (like cholesterol, chest pain)
- Loss curve visualization for model performance
